the code of iOS game "The Eggs Pro" by i4nApps

the code has not been touched for a long time, so it has a bunch of problems
- the used open feint version is too old
- open feint source code is included, feel free to remove it and write some manual on how to link it locally
- lots of compiler warnings
- some left-over images and code for 'DISKOTEKA_90' promotion

set 'fullFeatures' to TRUE to enable Game II mode and replay
set 'fullSkins' to TRUE to enable all other skins

there's plenty of room to upgrade and improve
- do not require game to restart when skin is changed
- better graphics and better design (make "hd" version and ipad version)
- game center integration
- make universal application bundle

the app runs on iPod Touch 1G for sure
however, it crashed while booting on iPhone 4.3 simulator, I believe that open feint crashed, since it's the first view to appear after launch image
